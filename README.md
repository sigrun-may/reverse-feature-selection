## Overview

`reverse_feature_selection` is a Python package designed to help with feature selection in high-dimensional data with
tiny sample size. It provides tools to identify irrelevant features, improving stability of subsampling-based feature
selection methods. The package is designed to be used in combination with existing machine learning workflows.

## Usage

Here is a [basic example](https://github.com/sigrun-may/reverse-feature-selection/blob/main/reverse_feature_selection/reverse_feature_selection_example.ipynb)
of how to use the `select_feature_subset` function. The function takes a pandas DataFrame as input
and returns a DataFrame with the selected features.

```python
# variables list_of_random_seeds, data_pandas_dataframe, array_of_train_indices must be defined additionally
from reverse_feature_selection.reverse_random_forests import select_feature_subset

# Example metadata
meta_data = {
    'n_cpus': 4,
    'random_seeds': list_of_random_seeds,
    # train correlation threshold defines the features correlated to the target to be removed from the training data
    'train_correlation_threshold': 0.3,
}

# Select feature subset
result_df = select_feature_subset(data_pandas_dataframe, array_of_train_indices, meta_data)

# print names of non-zero features
print(f"Selected features: {result_df[result_df['feature_subset_selection'] > 0]}")
```

### Input Format

- The input should be a pandas DataFrame. The first column must be named 'label' and contain the target variable.
  All remaining columns are considered input features.

- Training indices train_indices are a list of row indices indicating which rows are to be used for training.

The metadata dictionary must include the following keys:

```
n_cpus: Integer specifying the number of CPU cores to use.

random_seeds: A list of integers used as random seeds for reproducibility.

train_correlation_threshold: Float. Threshold to exclude features that are highly correlated with the 
                                    current target feature. Features with an absolute correlation 
                                    higher than this threshold will not be considered during training.
```

### Output

The function returns a pandas DataFrame with the selected feature subset in the 'feature_subset_selection' column. A numeric
column where a value greater than zero indicates that the feature was selected.
