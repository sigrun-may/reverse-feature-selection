    Calculate the mean out-of-bag (OOB) errors for random forests regressors with different random seeds

    based on the Mann-Whitney U test which determines whether there is a significant difference between the
    two error distributions. The test is configured for the hypothesis that the distribution of
    labeled_error_distribution is shifted to the left of the unlabeled_error_distribution.
    The Mann-Whitney U test is used to calculate the p-value based on the Out-of-Bag (OOB) scores of the labeled
    and unlabeled error distributions. The p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference
    could have occurred just by random chance. The smaller the p-value, the greater the statistical evidence
    to reject the null hypothesis (conclude that both error distributions differ).

        distributions, where the p_value is smaller or equal to 0.05. Features with values greater than 0 in this column
        are selected.
